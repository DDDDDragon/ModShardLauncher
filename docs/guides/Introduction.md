# ModShardLauncher

## What is **ModShardLauncher**?

**ModShardLauncher** is a tool to patch **mods** into StoneShard original data files.
In the past we modders use **UTMT** to edit the source code and save them.But if the game was updated, all the mods will be broken and different cannot work together unless you combine them by yourself.
To deal with these questions, I want to make a tool.It's **ModShardLauncher**.

## How **ModShardLauncher** works?

In fact, **UTMT** is made by C#.Using **UTMT**'s source code, **ModShardLauncher** can load data files.And with C#'s reflection, **ModShardLauncher** can load .dll files as mods and patch the modthings into data file.Then save them.

## I want to mod now!
