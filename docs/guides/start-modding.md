# Getting Started

## C# basic

If you want to make mods, please make sure you have basis of C#, or you won't understand how the api works.

## Download

In order to make **mods**, you can download **Visual Studio Community** first to easily make mod.

[Just download here.](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

During installation, check the `.NET Desktop Development` workload.Nothing else needs to be checked.

In the end, install `.NET 6.0 SDK` by visiting the dotnet download site, downloading the installer, and running the installer. You might need to restart Visual Studio or your computer after the install.

The other option is **Visual Studio Code**, in my opinion it's better than **Visual Studio** when making StoneShard mod.

## Create Your First Mod Project

Your first step is open the **ModShardLauncher.exe**, after running, it will create two folders in it's path————Mods and ModSources.

Then create a new folder in the ModSources folder, your first mod will begin from here.

### Create Mod

There are many ways to create your mod, if you use Visual Studio, you can run it then click **Create New Project**.
Search **Class Library**, click **Next**.
